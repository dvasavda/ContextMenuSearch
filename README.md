# RightClickMultiSearch
A simple Edge extension that allows you to right-click search the highlighted text through multiple search engines in Microsoft Edge.

1. User will be able to highlight any text phrase or term on a webpage, right click to open their context menu, and search with his/her selected choice of search engines.

2. Selected phrase or term will open in a new tab and will be searched through there.

3. An options page will be included in which the user may select his/her choice of search engines.


Q: Why develop such an extension?

The idea behind this extension is to open up a simple option for the users of Microsoft Edge. Microsoft Edge, a web browser included in Windows 10, is used by over 300 million people. Web browsers are made to research terms, ideas, and phrases; not being able to quickly search a phrase can be frustrating. In Microsoft Edge, the only available option is "Ask Cortana," which then opens up a sudo-Bing type of search engine as a sidebar. This is often not enough for a standard user, as Cortana may not serve as substantial as the search engine of a user's choice. On a side note, Cortana is not available to anyone outside of the United States; this only strengthens the execution of the extension. Simply put - more freedom is granted to the user for those who would like more than what Cortana provides.
